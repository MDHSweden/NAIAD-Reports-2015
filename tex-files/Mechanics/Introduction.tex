The main hull was already designed and constructed by the students from the previous year. This meant that a lot of the design decision had already been made. For example the over all shape of the robot and the thruster configuration was decided last year. The tool plate on the bottom of the robot as well as the wings were not constructed. These needed to be designed in detail and manufactured. The features of the tool plate, such as torpedoes, markers and a gripper, also needed to be designed. Several solutions for these have been studied.
