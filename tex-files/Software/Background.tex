\subsection{Background}
\noindent A lot of resources for software existed at start, both from Naiad and Vasa(which had parts of it based on RALF II\cite{Ralf_II}). The firmware for AT90CAN128 \cite{at90can128} was done and working quite good. Some vision was possible to reuse. Help from the previous Naiad team to get started quickly with both CAN-cards and BBB have been of significant help. %When it came to code from Naiad running on BBB, a standard where the name of functions and variables should be descriptive %enough to take a way the use of comments was used. This approach was either not implemented good enough or is not the way to %go when others will take over your work, for this reason none of that code was reused.
