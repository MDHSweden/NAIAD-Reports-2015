\subsection{Electronics discussion}
The electronics groups progress went really smoothly in the beginning. The cards from last year was already produced and add-ons seamed easy. However as further in in to the project we came the more it was important to not only be able to use the cards from last year but also understand them. Most of the documents regarding electronics from last year was sub-standard or missing completely therefore work on recreating this documentation have been done as well, taking up surprisingly large amount of time.

The electronics group have produced allot but as always when constructing hardware it takes longer time than expected and there had been an hope to reach further that we have done. For example have time to order final version cards from WÃ¼rth and ideally even have time to produce these cards. This have not been the case. All cards have been prototyped and tested but further works needs to be done on some cards. 

More than satisfactory work have been done from the members of electronics group. Plenty of new features have been added to Naiad by the work of the electronics group.
