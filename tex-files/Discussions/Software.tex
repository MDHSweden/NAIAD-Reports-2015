\subsection{Software discussion}
\noindent
The software group has worked well together reaching most of the primary goals, achieving a reliable base for future work.
\\
Documentation is just as important as the work you document on in projects of this magnitude. The documentation from the first Naiad team was hard to follow, making so that a lot (almost all) of the work had to be redone.
This year the software team has focused on following a standard that should be easy to use and using at most 3-5 layers of code in libraries to avoid having to spend much time understanding where values and functions descend from.\\
By combining the previous firmware from Naiad and from Vasa, a well working firmware has been achieved in short time, there is still some issues, but overall it works good.
\\
From the start the GIMME-2 boards was supposed to replace the BBBs but due to limitations of the operating system running on the GIMME-2 boards this would not be an effective alternative.
\\
A lot of problems hard to explain have occurred in the CAN-cards. Whether it is Ada or the firmware that causes it, the persons working with have tried to figure out but without any real success. These are not logical issues, but rather for example crashing when leaving a procedure, variables changing values without reasons etc.
