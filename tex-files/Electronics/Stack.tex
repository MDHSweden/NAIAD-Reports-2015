\subsection{Stacks} %Anette
The stacks from the previous group were replaced with stacks that had connectors on them to increase flexibility. The connector used is a four pin bottom entry socket header from WÃ¼rth electronics. The headers are placed on the back of the stack and the CAN-cards need to be inserted \emph{through} the card and the header. Otherwise the connections will not line up properly. The break away headers on the CAN-card need to be angled and longer than standard. The pins need to go through both card and connector and show on the back on order to make a secure fit. These stacks have 4 levels. Not all are intended to be used at the same time. This is due to size and space. There is nothing in the electronics that limits that all connections are used at once. The levels are there as redundancy as well as making it more versatile. If extra stability is decried the two pins to next to the power supply are not connected on any level and can be used as extra support.
