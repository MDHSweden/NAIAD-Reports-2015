\subsection{INS board}
The INS board is powered and delivers navigational data to a CAN-card. It delivers the data that the Inertial Measuring Unit(IMU) measures through a USART interface to the CAN card. It also measure values from the Fiber Optical Gyroscope(FOG) and sends it from the INS board to the CAN-card through a SPI interface. The INS board also offer the FOG the safe and stable power levels it requires. The FOG is very sensitive to voltage levels, especially when it comes to the 5V, 12V \& -12V lines, there are safety solutions implemented. As an example, to start the 5V three requirements needs to be fulfilled. A digital pin needs to be set high through software and the 12V \& -12V lines need to be active. This is because the FOG might break if the 5V power is on without $\pm$12V being active. When these requirements are fulfilled the FOG is active and the INS board can start supplying data to the CAN-card.
