\subsection{Remote control}
When the lid is closed and the Ethernet cable is not plugged in to Naiad there is no easy way to change settings. The remote controller is made to work on land. With the remote control one can navigate and change settings presented on the LCD display. The remote has 4 buttons and one slide switch. The four buttons is for navigating through the menu and the switch is for turning the remote on or off. Since there are no power saving function built in, the batteries in the remote controller will only last for 24 hours unless the switch is turned off after use. The remote uses a commercially bought transmitter and receiver circuit for sending data on the 433MHz FM band.
