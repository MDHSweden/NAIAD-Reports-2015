\subsubsection{Motor extension board} %Anette
The motor extensions board is, in it essence, an adapter. It provides the motor controller with 5V and GND from the CAN card as well as a PWM signal in a suitable connector. It has six three pin WR-WTB connectors from WÃ¼rth electronics, one for each motor controller. These were chosen since they prevent the user from connecting the cable upside down and is also has a locking mechanism. The current version of the board is made to be used with the 5.0 CAN-card.

\subsubsection{Motor controllers} %Patrik
The controllers was configured with the Castle Link V3.52.10 software. The reason the previous team had trouble with it was that since the firmware was altered from the supplier, some of the files for the setup program had to be replaced. The software is able to configure a number of thruster settings, one of which is the reverse type. The "crawler reverse" setting enables the motors to rapidly change rotational direction in order to make the AUV more agile.
