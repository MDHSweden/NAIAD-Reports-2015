# NAIAD

## About
The Naiad project was started in 2013 and has been developed by two classes of
M.Sc majoring in robotics and intelligent embedded systems. It is built to be
modular in both its electronics and its software. All electronics, mechanics
and software has been developed by students on MÃ¤lardalen University. Naiads
mechanics is designed for the vehicle to be small and lightweight with an
upgradable undercarriage. The main part of the software is built in Ada, which
has made the system robust.

There are 23000 barrels of toxic waste in the Baltic Sea, along with waste
from World War II. Even though the generations of today are not further
polluting the sea, this is still a problem since the barrels are corroding,
releasing the toxics. The long-term goal for Naiad is to help locate different
hazardous objects at the bottom of the Baltic Sea to secure a healthy
environment for future generations.
