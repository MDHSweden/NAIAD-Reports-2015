\section{Background and instroduction-PL}
The Naiad project was starded the fall 2013 and different groups of master students has been working on it sence then. This fall a light communication system has been starded to be developed and a wifi solution has been tested inorder to remove the current ethernet solution. There are several things left to implement in all systems in the Naiad project. Also a second Naiad robot has been started to be developed. The hull has been bought from Lars Asplund but the body has not been assembled.

This year the reseach in this project has taken a new direction. Multiagent behavior. A land based platform named kilobots has been invested in and the focus for the software team has been to investigat how to create coordinatesystems and patterns using the kilobots.

\section{Goals-PL}
For the Naiad platform the goals has been to build a second robot. Improve the power supply on the first robot. Go from ethernet cable to a wireless system for communication with the robot in surface mode. Also to develop two different underwater communication systems. One short range but fast with LED technology and one long range but more slow using sonar technology.
\subsection{Milestones}

\section{Requirements-PL}
Naiad platform new power supply, ring design.% Kolla med Albin
The wireless router shall be small enough to fit inside the current platform.
The wireless router must be able to work in the current system without major changes to the power plant.
The antenna for the wireless communication system shall resemble a stingray tail.
The antenna shall be stiff.
The antenna's length shall be 30 procent of the length of the Naiad platform.
The toolplate shall be able to mount the side sonars developed by DeepVisionAB in Lindk√∂ping.
The toolplate shall be build of the same material used on the current platform.
The underwater light communication shall be able to work in pool water with a range of 100 m.
The long range underwater communication system 



\section{Limitations-PL}
Because all the projects share the student resources this year, there has been a very limited amount of student working time set for this project, because there are two other projects in this course that has higher priorites.
The underwater communication system is going to be developed outside this course.
