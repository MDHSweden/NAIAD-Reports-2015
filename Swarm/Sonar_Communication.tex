\subsection{Introduction}
In order for the underwater robots to be able to communicate for long distances, a sonar communication system needs to be implemented.
Only a basic prestudie has taken place in this subject during this fall. It has been decided that this shall be Albin Barklund and Daniel Adolfssons master thesis work.
